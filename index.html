    <h1>The Trojan Room Coffee Pot</h1>

    <h2>A (non-technical) biography</h2>
    <i>by <a href="http://www.qandr.org/quentin">Quentin
    Stafford- Fraser</a></i>

    <p>Several people have asked about the origins of the <a
    href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/coffee.html">Trojan Room
    coffee pot</a>. It started back in the dark days of 1991,
    when the World Wide Web was little more than a glint in
    CERN's eye. I was working on ATM networks in a part of the
    Computer Lab known as the <a
    href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/site-maps/arup2.html">Trojan
    Room</a>, (a name which, perhaps, causes some amusement to
    American readers). There were about fifteen of us involved in
    related research and, being poor, impoverished academics, we
    only had one coffee filter machine between us, which lived in
    the corridor just outside the Trojan Room. However, being
    highly dedicated and hard-working academics, we got through a
    lot of coffee, and when a fresh pot was brewed, it often
    didn't last long.</p>

    <p>Some members of the 'coffee club' lived in other parts of
    the building and had to navigate several flights of stairs to
    get to the coffee pot; a trip which often proved fruitless if
    the all-night hackers of the Trojan Room had got there first.
    This disruption to the progress of Computer Science research
    obviously caused us some distress, and so <i>XCoffee</i> was
    born.</p>
